# Some examples of Twilio Electric Imp

There's a bunch of folders in here with Electric Imp code that you can use to get started playing with Electric Imp and Twilio IoT.

These examples are designed for the [Imp001 ImpExplorer Kit](https://store.electricimp.com/products/impexplorer-developer-kit?variant=32325242585148). [Follow these instructions to get started with your dev kit.](https://developer.electricimp.com/gettingstarted/explorer). A lot of the examples in the folders build on this original setup process.

*NOTE:* For the Imp001, you will need to connect to a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi network. (Other versions of the Imp can connect to the 5.0 GHz network, but these only work over 2.4 GHz.)

Each of the examples helps you do a different thing with your Imp001 Explorer. The [original example](https://store.electricimp.com/products/impexplorer-developer-kit?variant=32325242585148) in this getting started guide will help you set up your Explorer and blink a light over the internet. From there, you might want to try one of the examples here that will tell you how to:

- [Sending data to Twilio Studio based on a trigger condition on the board](/imp-to-studio)
